# âœŒðŸ‘¶.ml

> URL shortener using GitHub Issues

## Introduction

âœŒðŸ‘¶.ml is a little URL Shortener using GitHub Pages and GitHub Issues.

To shorten a link, [create an issue](https://github.com/n1c00o/xn--7biy268m.ml/issues/new), entitle it with the URL to redirect to and add the [link label](https://github.com/n1c00o/xn--7biy268m.ml/labels/link) to your issue.
*(Issues not labeled with the link label cannot be used by the shortener)*

Your shortened URL should be available at `âœŒðŸ‘¶.ml/<issue number>`.

## Example

`âœŒðŸ‘¶.ml/1` -> [here](https://github.com/n1c00o/xn--7biy268m.ml/issues/1)

## Note

I recently saw the [nelsontky's project](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener) and I decided to create my own.
